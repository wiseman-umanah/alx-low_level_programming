## ARGUMENTS AND ARGUMENT COUNT

In C programming, command line arguments are used to pass information into a program at the time it is executed.
These arguments are handled using two parameters typically named argc and argv in the main function.
The argc parameter represents the number of command line arguments passed, while argv is an array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
If you need to pass any arguments to your program, you can do so by typing them after the program name in the command line.
