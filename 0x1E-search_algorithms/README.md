## SEARCH ALGORITHM

Search algorithms are fundamental to the field of computer science and play a crucial role in the functionality of various applications, particularly in the realm of data retrieval. These algorithms are designed to efficiently locate specific data within a larger dataset or to solve problems by exploring possible solutions. The effectiveness of a search algorithm is measured by its ability to provide accurate and relevant results in a timely manner. There are several types of search algorithms, each with its own set of strategies and use-cases. For instance, linear search offers a straightforward approach suitable for small datasets, while binary search provides a more efficient method for sorted datasets. More complex algorithms like depth-first or breadth-first search are used in graph theory to navigate nodes, and heuristic algorithms like A* are employed for pathfinding in artificial intelligence. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the task at hand.

## EXAMPLES OF SEARCH ALGORITHM
- Linear Search Algorithm
- Jump Search Algorithm
- Binary Search Algorithm
- Interpolation Search Algorithm
- Exponential Search Algorithm

> LINEAR SEARCH ALGORITHM:
The linear search algorithm is a straightforward approach to finding a specific value within a list. It works by sequentially checking each element of the list until the desired value is located or the end of the list is reached. This method is best suited for small or unsorted datasets where efficiency is not the primary concern.

> JUMP SEARCH ALGORITHM: 
The jump search algorithm is an efficient searching technique for sorted arrays. It operates by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements. The optimal block size to be skipped is typically the square root of the array length. Once the block where the element is likely to be is found, a linear search is then used within that block to locate the exact element. This approach can significantly reduce the number of comparisons needed to find an element.

> BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM:
The binary search algorithm is an efficient method for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

> INTERPOLATION SEARCH ALGORITHM:
The interpolation search algorithm is an efficient searching technique that works on the principle of divide and conquer. It is particularly useful for uniformly distributed datasets. Instead of starting the search by comparing the target value with the middle element (as in binary search), interpolation search calculates the probable position of the target value using the formula: pos = low + [(high-low) / (arr[high]-arr[low]) * (x - arr[low])], where arr is the array, x is the target value, low and high are the range indices.

> EXPONENTIAL SEARCH ALGORITHM:
The exponential algorithm works by moving times 2 for each iteration. If the value searched for is less than the current number then binary search implementation is used for find the value in the array.
