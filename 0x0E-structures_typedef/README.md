## STRUCTURES

In C programming, structures (structs) are a way to group related variables of different types under a single name. 
They provide a means of packing together data of different types. 
A struct is defined using the `struct` keyword, followed by a series of variable declarations enclosed in braces. 
Each variable within a struct is called a member, and they can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. 
Structs are particularly useful for creating complex data types that represent objects or concepts in the real world, such as a date structure containing day, month, and year members.
