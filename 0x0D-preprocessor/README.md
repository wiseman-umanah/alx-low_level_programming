## Preprocessor

In C programming, the preprocessor is a powerful tool that processes directives before the actual compilation of code begins.
These directives, which begin with the '#' symbol, instruct the compiler to perform specific tasks such as macro expansion, file inclusion, and conditional compilation. 
The preprocessor enhances the flexibility and efficiency of C code by allowing for code reusability and modular programming.
It operates by scanning the code for these directives and executing them to produce a modified version of the source code, which is then passed on to the compiler for further processing.
